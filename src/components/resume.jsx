		<h2>Relevant Experience Within Field</h2>
		<p>At Edina High School I advanced interest in Engineering by completing Introduction to Engineering Design, Principles of Engineering, Engineering Design and Development, and AP Computer Science. Projects completed required working with Autodesk Inventor, breadboard circuits, and learning the basics of programming through Java. At the University of Minnesota, I am advancing my interest within the computer science field by having taken Introduction to Computing and Programming where I completed studies in Python, Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures where we worked with Java and learned more about memory and code efficiency, and Discrete Structures of Computer Science where we learned about truth tables, induction, and encryption. Completed Elementary Computational Linear Algebra, Machine Architecture and Organization(working in C), and Advanced Programming Principles(OCaml). Currently, I am taking Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures where we delve into learning computational critical thinking skills, learning algorithms like Merge-Sort, Matrix-Chain Multiplication, and Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. Introduction to Operating Systems is another class I am taking where we are working further into systems calls and working on the fundamentals of networking, thread, and processes, using C and Linux.</p>
